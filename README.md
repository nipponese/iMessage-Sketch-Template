# iPhone 7 + iMessage Sketch Template
This is just a simple Sketch template with the iMessage extenion UI elements as vector art. Comes in compact and expanded mode.

Note this template is meant for UX wireframe purposes only, as it is missing several trivial elements (like input field placeholder text) that would make this suitable for mockup purposes.
